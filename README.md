MMMCalc
=======

This is a very simple project, it was made for educational purposes (hence why it is open-source), and I encourage everyone to contribute if they have something to add.

The most simple way to build this project is to move to the src folder/directory and run

	$ javac MMMCalc.java

This will allow you to build the project that should work properly if you are downloading one of the releases (if you download the straight from the master branch it might have some problems).
